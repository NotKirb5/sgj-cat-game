9/23 – initial brainstorming sesh\!

- **theme: 9 to 5**  
  - corporate job → make it whimsical  
    - take everything that people hate about 9-to-5s, flip it upside down  
      - what do people hate?  
        - long, monotonous work  
        - waking up  
          - could work in your dreams  
          - could have a clone work for you  
- exploring different plotlines in the office – maybe different characters?  
- 9 to 5 → 9 PM to 5 AM gaspppp  
  - cat boss baby  
    - cats are nocturnal\! could tie into cat working idea  
- something with cats  
  - escaping your 9-to-5 job? escaping the manager (antagonist?)  
  - you gotta have the cats somewhere  
    - MC sneaks the cat into work  
      - maybe the cat is super intelligent and does the work for the MC\!  
      - but the cat is a menace hehehehe  
  - 9-to-5 worker is very sleep-deprived and hallucinates silly  
- manager could be an evil cat from a different world  
  - evil manager cat is lazy, but the workers are trying to get the boss on track  
    - different plotlines????  
      - good ending → manager cat stops being lazy  
      - bad ending → company goes bankrupt  
      - Cat ending → ??? :3  
        - could be where the easter egg pops up  
        - a secret ending???  
        - low-poly dance montage → like catgirl  
- d\&d office campaign-like vn  
  - manager could secretly be evil → mc has to defeat them by very good at their job  
    - but the mc keeps on slacking and using clones or cat doppelgangers  
- stardew valley  
- magical girls?\!?\!?\!?\!?\!?  
  - transformation sequence\!\!\!\!\! (animated)  
    - lipika or jenna could do  
    - could be silly/memey (less effort/time needed)  
- stationery company  
- interactive component: we could have in the background things that they need to click/find  
  - finding stickers, pens, pencils, etc.  
  - point-and-click  
- mc could be dedicated to job and eager to help ppl find the perfect stationery   
  - cat could be dedicated, mc could be lazy???  
  - mc gets lots of promotions and lots of accomplishments → but very shy and don’t do it intentionally  
    - main quest → to get mc fired from the job  
      - cat might need to sabotage the mc so they get fired for their own good  
      - point-and-click → could knock over stuff  
        - cursor could be a cat paw  
- speedrun game → try to get your employee kicked out  
  - timer → cat has to knock over enough stuff   
    - gamer minigame → warioware  
    - after timer’s up → cat has to leave  
- same room → office  
  - collect stickers for extra points  
  - knock down stuff to also get points  
  - if you don’t collect enough points → mc gets a promotion  
    - collect more points → mc gets in trouble ooo  
  - cat could have thoughts giving hints for things you can interact with during the cat mode  
  - isekai into world with grump cats  
    - mc could have a dream sequence before they wake up and it’s just that  
    - maybe cats could be like ‘PAY ATTENTION TO ME RIGHT MEOW\!\!\!\!”  
-   
- part of cat’s motivation is getting more attention from the MC  
  - cat has an instagram where they get 0 likes and all they post is “meow”

- game is aware that you’re skipping through dialogue  
  - meta\!\!\!\!\!  
  - have to play subway surfers to get through dialogue

- two modes: cat mode / normal office  
  - cat mode: isometric view of cubicle, and it has all items  
  - normal office: eyes of employee

- could potentially switch to godot

**PROLOGUE**  
BACKGROUND: just a black screen, or a stock dreamy effect

- D: “Where… Where am I?”  
- D: (Oh\! It’s my cat\!)  
- ???: “Dazy\!”  
- D: (You can. TALK????)  
- ???: “Pleassssseeeee stay here and pet me\!”  
- D: (Don’t worry, I’m not going anyw- Wait, am I seeing double?)  
- Two ???s: “Meow meow meow meow\!\!\!\!”  
- D: (This is getting out of hand. There’s three- no, four- no, FIVE THOUSAND OF THEM???)  
- D: (And before I know it, my thoughts are drowned out by a chorus of expectant mews.)

\*alarm clock rings\*

BACKGROUND: house (could be a copyright-free image that fits the vibes)

- D: “Ahh\! Oh, phew, it was just a dream.. I was about to drown from the sheer fluffiness.”  
- (It’s eight o’ clock, right on the dot. I’m Dazy Washi, and someway, somehow, I’ve become the star worker of Stooples, a small stationery company. We might be small, but we’ve caught the attention of so many people across the country…)  
- D: (And you could say I’m the brains. Yes.. I design a lot of the pens, erasers, and other cute stuff people love and love to use\~)  
- D: (And I also do 99% of Manager Miu’s work. And also approximately 80% of my coworkers’ work. Oh, but it’s nothing, really\!)  
- D: (As long as I have a pumpkin latte in the morning, I can do anything, right? Hahaha…)  
- D: (S-sorry\! No more time to entertain you with my inner thoughts. This stationery isn’t going to make itself…)  
- D: “\*Sigh\* I can’t believe this is how I have to get dressed for work every morning. Manager’s been watching too much anime…”  
- D: (Can’t say I *completely* hate it, though.)

\*magical girl transformation\*  
POV switches to Sweet Potato\*

- D: Heh, that was really something, right? My sweet little Sweet Potato\~  
- SP: (My owner, Dazy, sweeps me up in her arms.)  
- SP: (Ugh… this is nice, but how DARE she call me Sweet Potato\!)  
- SP: (My true name, just so *you* know, is LORD Sweet Potato. I have to be prepared for when felines take over the world one day\!)  
- SP: (Though that might take a while. My neighbors just flop around and eat Mew Mix all day. Ugh\! One day they’ll understand..)  
- D: \*pat pat\*  
- SP: (Okayyyy. I guess maybe I don’t mind… Just this once\!)  
- D: “Ohsnapohsnapit’slike4:30Igottagetoutthedoornowfood’sinthetrayokaybyebyeSweetPotato\!\!\!\!”  
- SP: (She practically yeets me down and yoinks herself out of the room\!)

\*door shut\*

- SP: \*meows sadly\*  
- SP: (She could have lingered upon my fluffy brilliance just a moment longer before eloping to that terrible place once more. Such a tragedy…)  
- SP: (Hey\! Yeah, you. Are you surprised? Just so you know, I’m not just any ordinary cat. I’ve got an owner to save – from a terrible, no-good, very bad job\!)  
- SP: (Dazy never has any time for me anymore.. I miss her silly baby voice… how quickly she’d move around the lazer pointer… It’s like she’s already gone off to war…)  
- SP: (And she’s so, so tired, too. She’s not exactly nocturnal like me.. She always looks like she’s in need of a serious catnap\!)  
- SP: (Which is why I’ve got a mission. A plan like no other.)  
- SP: (With these little paws and claws of mine… Dazy won’t need to worry about a job anymore, because she won’t have a job after I sneak in\! Meowhahahahahaha\!)  
- SP: (And you, dear player, shall bear witness to my nyoble meowssion\!)

**PART 1 – EVENING (9 PM)**  
***Employee Mode***

BACKGROUND: office

\*door jingles\*

- M: “Dazyy\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! Hi hi\!\!\!\!\!\!\!”  
- D: “Ah, Manager Miu, hello. It’s good to see you.”  
- D: (I’m a bit late, but of course, Manager doesn’t care. They’ve always been a fly-at-the-seat-of-their-pajama-pants type…)  
- D: (I’m pretty sure their mom gave this job to them as a birthday gift. Well, at least they seem to be having fun.)  
- D: “Where’s everyone else?”  
- M: “Oh, seems like nobody else has come in yet\~ Lucky you, you’re the early bird\! Who gets warm, or something like that\!”  
- D: (It appears my other coworkers have begun emulating Manager’s behaviors. The most immediate consequence of this being that I’m the only one here…)  
- D: (Which is a-okay\! It’s totally, surely fine\! Just gotta lock-in, spiffen up, and everything will be just great\! For sure\!\! *Hhhhh*…)  
- M: “Oh yeah\! I got a super-duper surprise announcement for all of you guys. Except you’re like.. the only one here for me to tell it to.”  
- D: “Oh? What is it, exactly?”  
- M: “You’re getting… \*confetti\* ANOTHER PROMOTION\!”  
- D: “A-again??? But why???”  
- D: (I know I do a lot of work at this company, b-but… I’m not that skilled. I don’t get what everyone here sees in me…)  
- M: “Just kidding LOLLLLLL. But dude, you cannot WAIT to hear this.”  
- D: (Why do I feel… a sense of unease?)  
- M: “So I got an email from the creators of this super-cool magical girl anime, like bro they’re SO COOL I’m on like episode 7 and the dynamics between everyone on the team are-“  
- D: “…”  
- M: “ANYWAYS so they said that we could make super-special stationery for them\! But, uh, we need to get it done by.. Tomorrow.”  
- D: “T-tomorrow?\!”  
- D: “Manager, are you absolutely certain that.. this wasn’t a.. you know.. spam email?”  
- M: “NOOOOOO I SWEAR ITS REAL TRUST\!\!\! They sent me concept art of Sprinkle Sugar Buns… how could I say no to Sprinkle Sugar Buns…”  
- M: “Also they sent me the email last month hahaha whoops. Sorry dude, you’re like the only one who showed up for this, so…”  
- D: “So… you’re saying you want me to create a whole new stationery line.. by tomorrow.”  
- D: (I’m at a loss for words. Stooples (as usual) is counting on me. But this time feels deeply different.)  
- D: (If I can’t get this set done by tonight, I know Manager will be devastated. So devastated, in fact, that I wouldn’t be surprised if they did something drastic…)  
- D: (I really miss my cat at times like these…)   
- SP (hiding): \>:3  
- D: “N-not to worry, Manager\! I assure you, this set will be done by the end of my shift. I w-won’t let you down\!”  
- M: “Now that’s the Dazy I know\! Get this — if you can actually pull this off I’ll give you a super super mega ultra promotion.. *deluxe*\!”  
- D: (People with that much money.. scare me a bit. But I guess I can’t complain that they’re offering to be so generous\!)  
- D: (Time to go check out the details of this commission with Manager.. Here goes nothing — or should I say, everything.)

\*Dazy and Manager leave.\*  
\*SP sneaks into the office.\*

***Cat Mode***

- SP: \*huff huff\*  
- SP: (YES\! Adorable pens everywhere, a perfectly assembled desk, hair barettes here, there, and everywhere – this has GOT to be Dazy’s office. Also she literally just left it but shhh I was trying to make this dramatic-)  
- SP: (Time for me to do all the things I love doing, hehe. Okayyy, I try not to be too misbehaved around Dazy, but…)  
- SP: (At the shelter, trust me. I was their biggest menace\! Scratching up all the rugs, knocking over any cup I could find…)  
- SP: (I was the coolest cat in town\! Man, those were the days…)  
- SP: (Ugh, hope I’m not too rusty now. Can’t believe my first birthday was a few weeks ago… I’m already sooooo ancient…)   
- SP: (Time to cause as much havoc as I can\! Oh, but I gotta make sure I hide before Dazy comes back\!)

\*CAT MODE GAMEPLAY\*

- narrator/tutorial box: Help Sweet Potato get Dazy fired by finding items to knock over in her office before the timer runs out\!  
  - There might be a special sticker/stationery to find in the room that’ll give you extra points\! If you find all of them, something interesting might happen…

- SP: (All right\! Looks like I’ve caused a fair share of mischief. Wait a second — I hear footsteps\!)  
- SP: (Wheretohide wheretohide.. Oh\! Maybe if I squeeze in right behind this desk…)  
- SP: (Phew\! Just in time\! She won’t know a thing\~)  
- SP: (Dazy comes back, and types and types away. I practically fall asleep to the meownotonous noise..) 

**PART 2 – NIGHT (12 AM)**  
***Employee Mode***

- D: (It’s been three hours, and not a soul has showed up to this place.)  
- D: (Looks like I’m totally on my own here. Whichisokaywhichisgreatwhichisjustfineanddandy\!\!\!\! I’m totally not about to explode\!\!)  
- D: “Phew… Research is done, so it’s time to start working on all this new stationery. All I need is some tape, some plastic, and-“  
- D: (Wait a moment. What- what happened to my office?)  
- D: (These papers are overturned, my computer’s scratched up, and — ?\!)  
- D: “The stickers I just made — they’re gone?\!”  
- D: (I’m in absolute disbelief. I know I’m tired, but.. Did I dream making the past few stickers?)  
- D: (It’s like the whole desk has been ransacked. Things are out of place, papers sticking to my sleeves. My pulse won’t stop racing.)  
- D: “Okay, okay… deep breaths. Maybe I just misplaced them. Maybe the stickers are hiding under–”  
- D: (Nope. Not under the folders. Not in the drawers. Not even taped to the bottom of the desk, which yes, I did check. Don’t judge me.)  
- D: This doesn’t make sense – I just made those stickers. They were right here… I can still smell the ink\! Unless the ghosts are running a black-market stationery shop.  
- (The door creaks. Heavy footsteps shuffle closer. My stomach drops.)  
- M: Hey\!\! Wait, you doing alright? You look… kinda wired, dude.  
- D: “Manager\! Thank goodness. Something’s wrong. My stickers are missing, and the whole desk is a mess, and I–”  
- M: “Mn. Meh… it’s a little messy in here, I guess. Happens when you’ve been at it for a while.”  
- D: “Yes\! Messy, exactly\! Can you help me look? Please?”  
- (Manager bends down, lifts a couple of papers, takes a peek under the desk, then stands back up.)  
- M: “Nope, not seeing them. They’ll turn up, though. Stuff always does\!”  
- D: “…That’s it? That’s your big help?” (I don’t know what I was expecting..)  
- M: “Chill out, Daze\! Losing a thing ot two doesn’t mean you’re losing your mind. Probably just misplaced ‘em while you were in the zone.”  
- D: “Misplaced?\!\! I don’t just misplace a whole batch of stickers\! Unless I’m sleepwalking through arts-and-crafts disasters now.”  
- M: “That’s just a Tuesday around here\! Whatever\~”  
- (The manager pats the desk once, like closing a conversation, then heads for the door.)  
- M: Get back to it. Don’t let a little chaos throw you off.  
- D: …Unless–oh holy moly…unless I’VE BEEN ABDUCTED BY ALIEN SPACE COWS AND THEIR EXPERIMENTS MADE ME BELIEVE THAT I WORKED ON MAKING STICKERS IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THEIR PROBING SHENANIGANS.  
- D: (\*shakes head) No Dazy, think logically\!\! Now, where could those stickers have wondered off to? Hmmmmm…

***Cat Mode***

- SP: (Finally\!\!\!\! She’s out again\! Aw. I did feel kinda bad hearing her freak out a little, but..)  
- SP: (Gotta keep reminding myself. This is for the biggest, bestest cause in the WORLD\!)  
- SP: (And once I’m done, I can get all the headpats I’ve ever dreamed of\~  
- SP: (I scurry under the desk, my tail flicking with excitement. A sticker sheet clings to my paw.)  
- SP: (Look at this haul\! Perfectly glossy, beautifully cut, smells like victory. Of course she’s confused– she doesn’t realize I’m basically a professional thief. Meowhaha\!\!)  
- SP: (My ears twitch as a high-pitched voice drifts into the room.)  
- SP: (Uh-oh. The tall one’s here. Or uh, at least they seem tall, sitting in that big.. moving… couch thing. They’re… so chill. Almost suspiciously chill. What if they’re onto me?\!)  
- (They bend, searching under the desk. I freeze, my whiskers trembling. …But then, they lift one paper, shrug, and leave.)  
- SP: (Phew. They didn’t see a thing\! Classic manager– the guy could trip over a parade and just say, “neat”\!)  
- (I dart up onto a shelf, knocking a pen cup askew, just enough to add to the chaos.)  
- SP: (Heehee. Gotta keep her on her toes\! Can’t have her catching on too fast. Besides… watching her unravel is half the fun. Like a big, biggg ball of yarn\! Oh.. but maybe not too much…)  
- (I nuzzle the sticker sheet)  
  SP: (Don’t worry, D. It’s all for the cause. Someday you’ll thank me. …Right after I get all the headpats in the universe\~)

\*CAT MODE GAMEPLAY\*

**PART 3 – MORNING (3 AM)**  
***Employee Mode***

- D: (\*\*yawn\*\* I’m getting very tired, but I must continue working on this project\! I must not let Manager or our customers down\!\!\!)  
- D: Okay… okay, deep breaths. (Remember what you learned in choir practice\!) Maybe I simply misplaced the stickers?   
- D: Maybe they just… sprouted legs and walked away. Happens all the time, am I right? Totallynormalworkplacehazard. Haha, it’s not like Sweet Potato leapt onto my desk and had anything to do with it\!  
- SP: (\*\*deep gulp\*\*)  
- D: (Alright, Dazy. You need to stop talking to yourself and think logically…)  
- D: (Right. Tape. Plastic. Scissors. A functioning brain. I’ve got at least two of those, maybe three on a good day.)  
- ????: (tap-tap-tap-tap)  
- D: (...Wh–...What was that?\! No. Nope\! Don’t even start, it was probably just the printer. Or the fridge… or a raccoon with a master’s degree in office sabotage.)  
- D: (Holy cow, I feel like a spreadsheet somebody spilled coffee on. Speaking of – I could really go for a venti pumpkin latte with oat milk, 5 pumps of pumpkin sauce, 2 pumps of caramel sauce, extra whipped cream and sprinkles on top..)  
- D: (Haha… Yeah, that would be really nice to go for right about now. Okay Dazy... focus\! You’re just working at three in the morning with disappearing stationery and imaginary raccoons – totally normal\!)

***Cat Mode***

- SP: (Dazy seems to have completely lost her marbles… maybe I went too far?)  
- SP: (Am I really going to have a crisis about whether my actions these past few hours have been morally righteous or completely in the wrong?)  
- SP: (Nah. I’m just a silly cat :3)  
- SP: (Besides, the world’s biggest cause doesn’t wait for office hours\!\! Justice— and sticker heists— happen at night\!)  
- SP: (Note to self: sneak her one sticker back later. She’ll think she hallucinated it. Perfect plan, hehe.)

\*CAT MODE GAMEPLAY\*

**PART 4 – DAY (5 AM)**  
***Employee Mode***

- D: (It’s 5AM. The office lights hiss like skittish cats. My eyes feel like they’re lined with sandpaper, but I’m still here. Still working. Or… trying to.)  
- D: Morning. Ah… That’s what this is, right? Morning.. Sun’s probably rising, birds are chirping… and I’m stapling the same blank piece of paper for the fourth time.  
- D: (Piles of stationery are stacked in wobbly towers around me. Half the stickers are gone. The tape dispenser’s empty. My keyboard has crumbs in it that I don’t remember creating.)  
- D: What am I even *making* anymore? These aren’t stationery kits, they’re Frankenstein’s monsters. Tape here, folded paper there, and—oh, great. This one has glue on it. Lovely.  
- D: (There’s a crash. Something fell behind the desk. I freeze.)  
- D: “...Who’s there?”  
- ????: …  
- D: “Right. Nobody. Just me, and my tattered brain eating itself alive...”  
- D: (I lean back in the chair. For a second, I swear I see something darting past the filling cabinet. A shadow? A tail? No. I’m imagining things. …Right?)  
- D: “No more coffee. That’s it. No more coffee. I’m switching to… water. Or air. Yes…just air..”

Manager enters

- M: “Dazy Washi.”  
- D: “M-Manager?\!”  
- M: (completely monotone) “You have demonstrated… persistence. Obsession. An unhealthy attachment to stickers. This pleases upper management.”  
- D: “W-what?”  
- D: (This isn’t like Manager at all… What has gotten into them? Have they suddenly changed their tune in at the last possible moment..? They loom closer…)  
  M: “Continue your labor. Or… collapse. Either outcome is satisfactory.”  
- D: (I gulp. Suddenly, Manager is gone – and I’m wide awake again. …Mostly.)  
- D: (Wait a second… are they.. coming back? Wait, were they even here at all? Uwahhhhhh…)

***Cat Mode***

- SP: (This is it… the moment meow’ve all been waiting for. Or, uh, at least I have.)  
- SP: (It all comes down to this… Let’s get meowschievious\!)

\*CAT MODE GAMEPLAY\*

- SP: (Oh. Oh no. The big, not-really-scary-but-right-now-they’re-super-scary suit is here – The manager. I didn’t plan for this\!)  
- SP: (I crouch low behind the filing cabinet, my tail twitching. The stolen sticker stash glimmers in the dim light.)  
- SP: (If I just sneak out now, she’ll never know. Easy. Simple. …But if she sees me… ohhhh, it’s curtains. No more secret missions. No more crusade. No more HEADPATS\!\!\!\!)  
- SP: (I slowly edge forward. A pencil clatters to the floor. The manager’s head naps toward the sound.)  
  Manager: “Huh?? What’s that noise?”  
  SP: (...Eep\!\!\! ABORT MISSION\!\!\!\!)

***Employee Mode***

- M: “Daaaaaazy\!\!\!\!\!”  
- D: (It begins..)  
- M: “Dude, you’ve been working sooooooo much tonight. I can’t wait to see the awesome epic job you did\!”  
- D: (“Awesome” and “epic” are not the words I’d use to describe it.)  
- D: “I.. did my best…”  
- M: “Hehehe, let’s see what ya got\!”  
- D: (Manager is so nonchalant, but… has my fate been decided?)  
- D: (My heart pounds. Are they going to fire me? Promote me? …Turn me into stationery?)

**“GOOD” ENDING**

- M: “Wait… wha… what is this?”  
- D: (Oh no…)  
- M: “This… this isn’t enough at all\! Just a single pen? And a half-baked eraser?”  
- D: “Ah… I can-”  
- D: (How can I even explain? My stickers, my pens, they’re all– This was my fault, wasn’t it?)  
- D: (I should’ve known better than to try to take this on by myself…)  
- D: “No… maybe I can’t.. explain..”  
- M: “That blows, dude… My magical girl anime… They’ll never collab with us nowww…”  
- D: (I saw this storm coming from miles away. The always-smiley Manager now looks as though they’ll explode into tears…)  
- M: “Wahhhhhh\!\!\!\! I’m sorry dude but you are super duper FIRED\!”  
- D: (I say nothing. I’m speechless, yet unsurprised.)  
- D: (Should’ve drank another pumpkin latte… with oat milk… and *7* pumps of pumpkin sauce…)  
- D: (I blame the imaginary raccoons..)

**EPILOGUE (OF “GOOD” ENDING)**

BACKGROUND: house

- D: (After that exhausting night shift that went down in thankfully nonexistent flames, I haven’t a spark of energy left in my body…)  
- D: “Things might be awful, but… At least I have you, Sweet Potato.”  
- D: “You’re always there for me, meowing at my bedsheets in the morning and sitting on my keyboard at night…”  
- D: “Not like the people at Stooples. They always loved my work, but…”  
- D: “I wish they worked a little more, too.”  
- D: “Ah… I don’t need to stress too much if I’ve got you, Sweet Potato\~”  
- SP: (Teeheeheehee. So oblivious…)  
- SP: (It seems like my little heist was a.. MEOWGENDARY SUCCESS\!)  
- SP: (Why do I feel a little bad, though?)  
- SP: (...Nahhh, I’m Lord Sweet Potato. I don’t make meowstakes – vict-purr-y is always mine\! MEOW\!)

FIN

**“BAD” ENDING**

- M: “Dude.”  
- D: (I freeze up as Manager looks through my designs…)  
- M: “DUDDDEEEEEEEEEEEE.”  
- D: (...)  
- M: “THIS IS SOSOSOSOSOSOSOSOSO COOL\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!”  
- D: (A sigh of relief escapes me.)  
- M: “Ohhhhh wowww, I mean look at this sticker\! And this notebook? Knocks my slippers right off\!”  
- SP: (Oh no…)  
- M: “You even made a Sprinkle Sugar Buns-themed stapler… My precious blorbo…”  
- D: “Heh, yes, I did\!”  
- D: (I’m exhausted beyond words – but it seems that Manager is beyond pleased.)  
- D: (They don’t seem to notice the tornado that hit my office. Though I don’t remember being *quite* that clumsy…)  
- D: (Well, I definitely cannot complain now-)  
- M: “You know what we gotta do now, right?\! THAT’S RIGHT\! For being the raddest worker everrrr, you get to be: The SUPER-DUPER-MEGA-ULTRA EXECUTIVE OF ETERNAL STATIONERY PRODUCTION\!”  
- D: “M-Manager\!\! *E-eternal?*”  
- D: (And I thought being the Super-Duper Stationery Expert was a bit excessive…)  
- D: “That’s… that’s not a real title.. is it?”  
- M: “It is now, dude\! Congrat-u-lations\!”  
- SP: (My tail’s puffed, my eyes are wide.)  
- SP: (This just can’t be… All my hard work tonight, scratching things and knocking stuff over, has come to *this*?)  
- SP: (U-nya-cceptable\!)  
- SP: (She’ll have even longer hours… I’ll have to bid sweet adieu to my headpats… Woe is truly me…)  
- SP: (At least she’ll make more money to buy me something fancier than Mew Mix…)

**“SECRET” ENDING**

- SP: (Yes\! Just one more sticker and then she’ll certainly be out of-)

\*door open\*

- M: “Huh? What’s this?”  
- SP: (nONONO NYAT NOW-)  
- M: “Bro… This office really needs some patching up… It looks like the cat dragged it in\!”  
- SP: (I’m remaining as silent as possible, hiding behind the desk. There’s no way that weird human is gonna find me – right?)  
- \*squeak\*  
- M: “What was that..? Oh\!”  
- SP: (EEP\!\! Oh no, it’s back to the adoption center for me for sure… Is this what game meowver feels like?)  
- M: “Hi there, little guy\! Never thought I’d see an office kitty around here, but I guess there’s a first for everything, right?”  
- SP: (I’m totally frozen, my hair’s standing on end, ohnononono-)  
- SP: “Please don’t-”  
- M: “Don’t worry, my dude, I’m not here to hurt ya.”  
- SP: “WAIT.”  
- M: ?  
- SP: “YOU CAN UNDERSTAND ME?????”  
- M: “Yeah, what about it?”  
- SP: “HAVE YOU NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN FELINES AND HUMANS? This is– this is absolutely–”  
- M: “I thought everyone could do that.”  
- SP: “NO??????????????????????”  
- M: “Hahahaha. The more you know, I guess\! But what brings you here? Waitttttt a minute – you’re Dazy’s cat\!\!”  
- M: “Ohmigosh, I’m like, your BIGGEST FAN EVER\!\!\! She’s always showing me pics and you’re just the cutest little babyiest-”  
- SP: “\*sigh\*”  
- M: “Hm? What’s up?”  
- SP: “Well.. don’t meow-nd me being blunt..”  
- SP: (Without even realizing it, my fur’s standing up on end again, and I feel like hissing\!)  
- SP: “But you have GOT to stop putting all of this company’s work on Dazy\!\!\! Come on\!\! I’m just a little kitty and even I have the common sense not to exploit your one productive worker like that.”  
- M: “Wait, is that what it’s called? I just thought I’d give her more work because uhh.. she’s really good at it\!”  
- SP: “...You have *got* to be kitten me.”  
- (Aiya, this human’s got a furball for brains\! But maybe, jusssssssst maybe, I can knock some sense into them-)  
- M: “Ooooh\! I have a GREAT idea. So okay my mom actually gave me this job a couple months ago and was like “you need to learn how to be an Adult and do Adult things” right??? But I think I’m over this adulting thing already…”  
- M: “But you… Looking into your big ol’ eyes. Dude. I think you might have what it takes.”  
- SP: “Wait, wha-”  
- M: “How about YOU become the manager\!”  
- SP: ?\!?\!?\!?\!?\!?\!?\!?\!?\!  
- (And just like that, I, Lord Sweet Potato, was deemed the new manager of the Stooples Company\!)  
- (I’ve got a lot of work on my paws, but all my workers LOVE me. And I get to see Dazy all the time\!)  
- (Andddd, she doesn’t have to be sad about losing her job\! I guess we can call this mission a super success\! Meowsome\!)
